    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked dish consisting of stacked, alternating layers of pasta sheets (also called lasagna), sauce, cheese, and other ingredients like meat or vegetables. It originated in Naples during the Middle Ages and has become a globally beloved comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat Sauce: 1 lb ground beef or sausage, 1 onion (diced), 2-3 cloves garlic (minced), 24-32 oz marinara/crushed tomatoes, 1 tbsp Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>>Cheese Mixture: 15 oz ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese), 1 egg (beaten), 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 tbsp fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Assembly: 1 lb lasagna noodles (boiled or oven-ready), 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Sauce: Brown ground beef/sausage and onion in a large skillet; add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in tomato products and seasonings; simmer for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, beaten egg, Parmesan cheese, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Prep Oven/Pan: Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 1 (Bottom): Spread $\sim$1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Layer 2 (Noodles): Place 3-4 noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Layer 3 (Cheese): Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Layer 4 (Mozzarella): Sprinkle 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>>Repeat: Repeat layers of sauce, noodles, ricotta, and mozzarella twice more.</li>
        <li>Top Layer: Top with remaining noodles, sauce, and a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover with foil (sprayed with cooking spray to prevent sticking) and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finish: Remove foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Rest: Let the lasagna rest for at least 30 minutes before slicing to ensure it holds its shape.</li>
    </ol>
